You are given an array of integers that represents the IDs of the users that have registered in “UpgradBook,” a private social network created for all the students who have graduated from Upgrads’ programs.

The array of integers has the following properties:
* With a known length N
* The array is sorted in an ascending order
* The array holds distinct integers (i.e. there are no repeating numbers)
* The array is 1-indexed, i.e. the first element is stored in A[1] (not A[0])

Find the first positive integer M (where 1 <= M <= N) such that when M is used as the array index, the result from the array is the the integer M itself. i.e. A[M] = M
In other words, find the first positive integer M where M is both a user’s ID and its index in the array of user ids.
Write a program to find M, if it exists, in O(log N) time. If M does not exist, please return NOT_FOUND

Please note that the code takes two inputs:
First one being the size of the array
Second one being the elements inside the array
So, to input an array having 5 elements, the first input will be 5 and the next 5 inputs will be the elements of the array.

Test Case ;
In this part of the problem you are supposed to find an element whose value is equal to its index. The code should print first such instance in the array.
Sample Input:
5
0 1 3 4 5
Sample Output:
3
In this case 5 is the size of the array.
0 1 3 4 5 are the elements of the array where the element 0 is at index 1 and not at index 0. So we effectively do not use the index 0 of the array and start filling the array from index 1 only.
Output is 3 because at index 3 the value of the element is 3 only. Though at index 5, the value of the element is also 5 but the code should print first such occurrence.
One more test case is given below
Input :
7
0 1 2 4 5 6 7
Output :
4
